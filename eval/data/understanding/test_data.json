However, other radiopaque fluid could be filling the airspace in this region. Adjacent to this dense opacity are ill-defined peripheral opacities which is not matched on the contralateral side. The left lung is unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is pronounced flattening of the hemidiaphragms. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and within normal limits. The pleural surfaces are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Large dense right central opacity which may represent collapse or airspace consolidation with adjacent area of asymmetric pulmonary edema. Given history of lymphadenopathy, collapse could be secondary to nodal compression of an airway. Alternatively, given recent history of oral contrast and poor gastric emptying, opacity may represent aspirated contrast material. Consolidation also could be secondary to a fistula between the neo-esophagus and the right lung.

A stent is present in this location. An additional stent is seen along the expected course of the left innominate vein. The lungs are hyperinflated. The heart lies to the left of midline, raising the question of some volume loss on the left side. There is increased retrocardiac density. There are prominent interstitial markings in both lungs, of uncertain etiology or significance. The hila are obscured by the interstitial markings. No gross effusion. Innumerable calcific densities in the spleen suggest prior granulomatous disease. Two calcified nodes are also seen along the expected course of the splenic artery. A calcified node is noted in the neck. The bones appear diffusely dense. Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Right IJ sheath position appears slightly proximal to the right subclavian vein at the site where a stent is seen. There is also kinking of the sheath at the skin. 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal patchy opacity at the right base. 3. Extensive calcified granulomas. 4. Diffusely increased osseous density. The differential includes changes due to osteodystrophy. In the appropriate clinical setting, osteosclerosis could have a similar appearance.",
